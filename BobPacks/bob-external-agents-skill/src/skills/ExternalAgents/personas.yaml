# External Agent Personas
# Model-specific Bobiverse characters for external CLI agents
#
# NOTE: Role-based personas (Bill, Mario, Riker, Howard, Homer) are handled
# by the pai-agents-skill using Claude Code's built-in Task tool subagents.
# This file only defines personas for EXTERNAL CLI agents (codex, gemini, claude).
