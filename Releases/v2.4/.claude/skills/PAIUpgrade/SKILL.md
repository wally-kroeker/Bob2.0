## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the PAIUpgrade skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **PAIUpgrade** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# PAIUpgrade Skill

**Primary Purpose:** Generate prioritized upgrade recommendations for the user's existing PAI setup by understanding their context and discovering what's new in the ecosystem.

The skill runs **two parallel agent threads** that converge into personalized recommendations:

```
Thread 1: USER CONTEXT           Thread 2: SOURCE COLLECTION
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│ TELOS Analysis      │         │ Anthropic Sources   │
│ Project Analysis    │         │ YouTube Channels    │
│ Recent Work History │         │ Custom USER Sources │
│ PAI System State    │         │ Community Updates   │
└─────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
           │                              │
           └──────────┬───────────────────┘
                      ▼
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │  PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDATIONS │
        │  (personalized to user)      │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Upgrade** | "check for upgrades", "check sources", "any updates", "check Anthropic", "check YouTube", "upgrade", "pai upgrade" | `Workflows/Upgrade.md` |
| **ResearchUpgrade** | "research this upgrade", "deep dive on [feature]", "further research" | `Workflows/ResearchUpgrade.md` |

**Default workflow:** If user says "upgrade" or "check for upgrades" without specifics, run the **Upgrade** workflow.

---

## Primary Output Format

**Granular. Extracted. PAI-Contextualized.**

The output provides SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES extracted from actual content, not links to watch or recommendations to read. Every tip explains WHY it matters for YOUR PAI system.

```markdown

## Extraction Rules

**CRITICAL: Extract, don't summarize. Techniques, not recommendations.**

1. **Every output item must be a TECHNIQUE** - A specific pattern, code snippet, configuration, or approach
2. **Quote or code-block the actual content** - Show exactly what was said/written
3. **Map to PAI components** - Every technique must connect to a specific file, skill, workflow, or system component
4. **Two mandatory description fields (16-32 words each):**
   - **What It Is:** Describe the technique itself - what it does, how it works, what capability it provides
   - **How It Helps PAI:** Describe the specific benefit - which component improves, what gap it fills, what becomes possible
5. **Provide implementation** - Show before/after code or specific steps
6. **Skip, don't dilute** - If content has no extractable technique, put it in Skipped Content with reason

**Anti-patterns to AVOID:**
- ❌ "Check out this video for more"
- ❌ "This release has improvements"
- ❌ "Consider looking into this"
- ❌ Vague summaries without specific techniques
- ❌ Links without extracted content

**Source Type Labels:**
| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `GitHub: claude-code vX.Y.Z` | Specific version release notes |
| `YouTube: Creator @ MM:SS` | Video with timestamp |
| `Docs: Section Name` | Documentation section |
| `Blog: Post Title` | Blog post |

## The Two-Thread Architecture

### Thread 1: User Context Analysis

**Purpose:** Deeply understand the user to personalize recommendations.

Launch **parallel agents** to analyze:

| Agent | Focus | Sources |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **TELOS Agent** | User's goals, challenges, current focus | `skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/*.md` |
| **Project Agent** | Active projects, tech stacks, dependencies | TELOS/PROJECTS.md, recent work context |
| **History Agent** | Recent work patterns, what's been done | `MEMORY/WORK/`, `MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json` |
| **PAI State Agent** | System capabilities, installed skills, gaps | `skills/`, `hooks/`, `settings.json` |

**Output:** A context object that includes:
- User's current focus areas and priorities
- Active projects and their tech stacks
- Recent work patterns and themes
- PAI system state and existing capabilities

### Thread 2: Source Collection

**Purpose:** Discover what's new in the ecosystem.

Launch **parallel agents** to check:

| Agent | Focus | Sources |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Anthropic Agent** | Official Anthropic updates | `Tools/Anthropic.ts` (30+ sources) |
| **YouTube Agent** | Configured channels for new videos | USER customization channels |
| **Custom Source Agent** | Any USER-defined additional sources | USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/PAIUpgrade/ |

**Output:** A collection of discoveries:
- New features, releases, changes from Anthropic
- New videos with transcripts and key insights
- Updates from custom sources

---

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Launch Both Threads in Parallel

Using BACKGROUNDDELEGATION, spawn both analysis threads simultaneously:

```markdown
## Thread 1: User Context (4 parallel agents)

### Agent 1: TELOS Analysis
Read and analyze:
- ~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/TELOS.md
- ~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/GOALS.md
- ~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/PROJECTS.md
- ~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/CHALLENGES.md
- ~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/TELOS/STATUS.md

Extract: Current focus, priorities, active goals, project themes

### Agent 2: Recent Work Analysis
Read and analyze:
- ~/.claude/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json
- Recent MEMORY/WORK/ directories

Extract: What user has been working on, patterns, open tasks

### Agent 3: PAI System State
Analyze:
- ~/.claude/skills/ (installed skills)
- ~/.claude/hooks/ (active hooks)
- ~/.claude/settings.json (configuration)

Extract: Current capabilities, potential gaps, system health

### Agent 4: Tech Stack Context
From PROJECTS and recent work, identify:
- Languages and frameworks in use
- Deployment targets
- Integration points

---

## Thread 2: Source Collection (3 parallel agents)

### Agent 1: Anthropic Sources
Run: bun ~/.claude/skills/PAIUpgrade/Tools/Anthropic.ts
Check all 30+ official sources for updates

### Agent 2: YouTube Channels
Check configured channels for new videos
Extract transcripts from new content

### Agent 3: Custom Sources
Check any USER-defined additional sources
```

### Step 2: Synthesize Results

Once both threads complete:

1. **Merge context:** Combine user analysis into unified context object
2. **Filter discoveries:** Remove items that don't apply to user's stack/focus
3. **Score relevance:** Rate each discovery against user's TELOS and projects
4. **Prioritize:** Sort by (relevance to user × impact × ease)

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

For each discovery that passes relevance filtering:

1. **Personalize:** Explain why this matters for THIS user specifically
2. **Contextualize:** Map to their projects, goals, and challenges
3. **Actionize:** Provide concrete implementation steps
4. **Estimate:** Rate effort relative to their experience level

### Step 4: Output Report

Generate the prioritized recommendations report (see format above).

## Configuration

**Skill Files:**
- `sources.json` - Anthropic sources config (30+ sources)
- `youtube-channels.json` - Base YouTube channels (empty by default)
- `State/last-check.json` - Anthropic state
- `State/youtube-videos.json` - YouTube state

**User Customizations** (`~/.claude/skills/CORE/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/PAIUpgrade/`):
- `EXTEND.yaml` - Extension manifest
- `youtube-channels.json` - User's personal YouTube channels
- Additional source definitions

---

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Tools/Anthropic.ts` | Check Anthropic sources for updates |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Extract, Don't Summarize:** Pull specific techniques from content, never just link to sources
2. **Quote the Source:** Show actual code, documentation quotes, or transcript excerpts
3. **PAI-Contextualized:** Every technique maps to a specific PAI file, skill, or component
4. **Explain "Why You":** Use phrases like "This helps because your [X] currently [Y]"
5. **TELOS-Connected:** Reference user's goals and challenges when explaining relevance
6. **Skip Boldly:** If content has no extractable technique, skip it entirely
7. **Implementation-Ready:** Provide actual code changes, not vague recommendations

---

## Examples

**Example 1: Standard upgrade check**
```
User: "check for upgrades"
→ Launch Thread 1 (4 agents analyzing user context)
→ Launch Thread 2 (3 agents checking sources)
→ Wait for both threads
→ Synthesize into prioritized recommendations
→ Output personalized upgrade report
```

**Example 2: Quick Anthropic-only check**
```
User: "check Anthropic only"
→ Run Anthropic.ts tool directly
→ Use cached user context from recent session
→ Quick-match against user focus areas
→ Output filtered recommendations
```

---

## Workflows

- **Upgrade.md** - Primary workflow: full two-thread analysis with prioritized recommendations
- **ResearchUpgrade.md** - Deep dive on a specific upgrade opportunity

---

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Output)

These output patterns are **FAILURES**. If you produce these, you have not completed the skill correctly:

| ❌ Bad Output | Why It's Wrong | ✅ Correct Output |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| "Check out R Amjad's video on Claude Code" | Points to content instead of extracting it | "@ 5:42, R Amjad shows this technique: [quote]" |
| "v2.1.16 has task management improvements" | Vague summary, no technique | "v2.1.16 adds `addBlockedBy` parameter: [code example]" |
| "Consider looking into MCP updates" | Recommendation without extraction | "MCP now supports [specific feature]: [docs quote]" |
| "This could be useful for your workflows" | Vague relevance | "This improves your Browser skill because [specific gap it fills]" |
| "Several videos covered AI agents" | Count without content | "[N] videos skipped - no extractable techniques" |
| "This helps because it improves things" | Vague benefit, no word count | "How It Helps PAI (16-32 words): Our SecurityValidator currently only blocks commands. This technique enables injecting reasoning context before tool execution, making security decisions more nuanced." |
| "A new hook feature" | No description of what it IS | "What It Is (16-32 words): PreToolUse hooks can return additionalContext that gets injected into the model's context before execution, enabling reasoning-based decisions rather than binary blocks." |

**The test:** If you can say "show me the technique" and there's nothing to show, you've failed.

**Word count test:** Each "What It Is" and "How It Helps PAI" field MUST be 16-32 words. Count them. If under 16, add specificity. If over 32, condense.

---

**This skill embodies PAI's commitment to continuous, personalized improvement - understanding YOU first, then discovering what's new, then EXTRACTING the actual techniques that matter to your system.**
