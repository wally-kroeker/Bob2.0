## Quarterly Review

**Last Review:** 2026-01-16 (informal assessment)
**Next Review:** 2026-04-01

### What's Working
- Network referrals delivering opportunities (Jean → Red River, Rees intro to Circuit & Chisel)
- Authentik deployment successful (sovereignty infrastructure proven)
- Bob/AI infrastructure demonstrating consulting expertise
- Honest positioning preventing skills-mismatch struggles

### What Needs Attention
- Income stability (R1 critical - employment decision imminent)
- Service migration to SSO (Phase 4 ready but not executed)
- Documentation debt (G1 ongoing but not systematized)

### Adjustments
- Prioritize employment over consulting in short term (R1 mitigation)
- Execute Phase 4 SSO migration after employment secured
- Quarterly CORE/USER sync (not continuous) to reduce maintenance burden

## Values Alignment Check

Am I spending time on what matters most?

| Area | Importance (1-10) | Time Spent (1-10) | Gap | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----|-------|
| GoodFields Income | 10 | 9 | -1 | Active job search, multiple leads |
| FabLab Infrastructure | 7 | 5 | -2 | Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 pending |
| StillPoint Vision | 8 | 3 | -5 | Deferred until income stable |
| Relationships | 9 | 7 | -2 | Repaired, ongoing poly journey |

**Assessment:** Focus correctly prioritized on income (R1). StillPoint gap acceptable given urgency. Relationships stable after repair work.
