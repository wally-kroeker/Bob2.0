# Analyze AI Trends Workflow

Perform deep trend analysis across historical AI news logs to identify patterns, paradigm shifts, and future predictions.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Historical Data

Read all files from: `~/.claude/History/research/` (filter for AI news files)

Files may be in various formats: analysis.md, comprehensive-analysis.md, etc.

Sort chronologically to understand evolution over time.

### Step 2: Analyze Trends

Use the Task tool with subagent_type="GeminiResearcher" to identify:

- **EVOLVING TRENDS**: What patterns are emerging, strengthening, or weakening over time?
- **RECURRING THEMES**: What topics, companies, or technologies keep appearing?
- **TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS**: Where is the industry heading based on the progression of developments?
- **PARADIGM SHIFTS**: What major changes or inflection points can be identified?
- **COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**: How are different companies, models, or approaches competing?
- **INNOVATION VELOCITY**: Is the pace of innovation accelerating, stabilizing, or slowing?
- **EMERGING WINNERS**: Which models, tools, or approaches are gaining momentum?
- **DECLINING AREAS**: What's becoming less relevant or being abandoned?
- **SURPRISING PATTERNS**: What unexpected trends or correlations emerge?
- **FUTURE PREDICTIONS**: Based on trends, what's likely to happen next?

### Step 3: Generate Report

## Important Notes

- Read ALL log files in chronological order
- Look for patterns across multiple entries, not just individual items
- Identify both obvious and subtle trends
- Focus on actionable insights
- Use GeminiResearcher for deep analysis with context from all logs
- If fewer than 3 log files exist, note that trend analysis is limited
- Emphasize what's changing over time, not just what's happening
