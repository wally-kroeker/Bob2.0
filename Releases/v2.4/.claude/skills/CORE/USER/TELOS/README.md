# TELOS Framework

**Your complete life operating system.**

TELOS (Greek: τέλος) means "purpose" or "ultimate aim" - the end toward which all actions are directed. This framework captures who you are, what you believe, and where you're going.

## Numbering System

TELOS uses a consistent numbering system to create connections between elements:

```
M0, M1, M2...   = Missions (your ultimate purposes)
G0, G1, G2...   = Goals (specific objectives)
C0, C1, C2...   = Challenges (obstacles to overcome)
S0, S1, S2...   = Strategies (approaches to problems)
P0, P1, P2...   = Problems (world problems you're solving)
N0, N1, N2...   = Narratives (talking points)
B0, B1, B2...   = Beliefs (core beliefs)
FR0, FR1...     = Frames (useful perspectives)
MO0, MO1...     = Models (mental models)
TR0, TR1...     = Traumas (formative experiences)
I0, I1, I2...   = Ideas (things to explore)
```

---

## Hierarchy

```
MISSIONS (M#)
    ↓ supported by
GOALS (G#)
    ↓ blocked by
CHALLENGES (C#)
    ↓ addressed by
STRATEGIES (S#)

PROBLEMS (P#) → inform → GOALS (G#)
BELIEFS (B#) → guide → all decisions
MODELS (MO#) → shape → understanding
FRAMES (FR#) → provide → perspective
```

---

## Cross-Referencing

Link items across files:

```markdown
### G0: Launch Product X
**Supports:** M1
**Blocked By:** C1, C2
**Strategy:** S1
```

This creates a connected system where you can trace:
- Which missions a goal supports
- Which challenges block a goal
- Which strategies address which challenges

---

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Start with `MISSION.md` - define your core purposes
2. Move to `GOALS.md` - what specific outcomes support those missions
3. Add `CHALLENGES.md` - what's blocking you
4. Develop `STRATEGIES.md` - how you'll address challenges

### Regular Reviews
- **Weekly:** STATUS.md, GOALS.md progress
- **Monthly:** CHALLENGES.md, STRATEGIES.md effectiveness
- **Quarterly:** MISSION.md alignment, full system review

### Continuous Updates
- Add to LEARNED.md and WISDOM.md as you learn
- Update WRONG.md when you change your mind
- Capture IDEAS.md as they come
- Make PREDICTIONS.md to calibrate your thinking

## Philosophy

TELOS is based on several principles:

1. **Self-knowledge is power** - Understanding yourself deeply enables better decisions
2. **Connection matters** - Linking goals to missions creates meaning
3. **Honesty required** - These files are for you; be truthful
4. **Living documents** - Update as you evolve
5. **Private by default** - This is personal; share selectively

## Example: Connected System

```
M1: Increase human flourishing through technology

    G1: Launch AI tool for education (supports M1)
        - Status: In Progress
        - Blocked by: C1 (time management)
        - Strategy: S1 (time blocking)

    G2: Write book on purpose (supports M1)
        - Status: Planning
        - Blocked by: C2 (procrastination)
        - Strategy: S2 (just start)

C1: Difficulty with time management
    - Addressed by: S1

S1: Time blocking system
    - Addresses: C1
    - Enables: G1, G3

P1: People lack meaning in life
    - Informs: M1, G1, G2
```

## Privacy Note

TELOS files are deeply personal. They are:
- Never synced to public repositories
- Only used locally by your AI
- Entirely optional (PAI works without them, but works better with them)

*Start with what you know. Add detail over time. The system will grow with you.*
