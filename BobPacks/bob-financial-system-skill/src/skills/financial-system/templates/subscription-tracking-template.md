## Notes

- Subscriptions are often the "easy win" for budget optimization — easy to forget, easy to cancel
- Annual subscriptions in envelope funds prevent surprise charges
- Documenting business use is critical for CRA compliance on migrated subscriptions
- Consider platform consolidation (e.g., do we need both of X and Y?)
